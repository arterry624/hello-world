hello
My name is Amanda, I currently work in a maximum security male prison. I hold a degree in criminal justice and am currently studying cyber security with hopes to become a digital forensic analyst. My fiance is studying the same degree and we have six kids so we stay pretty busy. I am looking forward to expanding my career with this new degree.
